# JS.ORG CLEANUP

Hello, it seems a `js.org` subdomain that was requested to target this repository no longer works.
The subdomain requested was `{{CNAME}}.js.org` and had the target of `{{TARGET}}`.
It produced the following failures when tested as part of the cleanup:
 - [HTTP](http://{{CNAME}}.js.org): `{{HTTP}}`
 - [HTTPS](https://{{CNAME}}.js.org): `{{HTTPS}}`

To keep the `js.org` subdomain you should add a page with [reasonable content](https://github.com/js-org/js.org/wiki/No-Content) within a month so the subdomain passes the validation.
Failure to rectify the issues will result in the requested subdomain being removed from JS.ORGs DNS and the list of active subdomains.

**If you are wanting to keep the `js.org` subdomain and have added [reasonable content](https://github.com/js-org/js.org/wiki/No-Content), YOU MUST reply to the [main cleanup issue]({{ISSUE}}) with the response format detailed at the top to keep the requested subdomain.**
