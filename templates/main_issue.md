# JS.ORG CLEANUP

The following `js.org` subdomains have been detected to no longer be working.

If you are the 'owner' of any of these subdomains and wish to still use them, please leave a comment below in the following format:

```
I am responsible for `xxx.js.org`.
It now has [reasonable content](https://github.com/js-org/js.org/wiki/No-Content) and is now working.
```

> **Subdomains that aren't accounted for after a month and are still down will be removed.**

 - Only once a domain has been validated by comment here from the 'owner' (see above) may the checkbox be ticked.
 - This file will be automatically parsed by a script at the end of the period, so please follow these instructions.
